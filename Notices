-I've got an email from a site called piece,
where they sell source code they have proposed the idea that I could sell my program on there 
I want to keep this software free and under the MIT license forever
free for everyone, free to modify :) to earn money from my projects I will add a donation link instead

-Forgot to put in here that I added a donation link on the website (https://lethalethan.github.io/Bluetooth-Unlock/)
so hopefully I can create more useful projects in the near future
-Don't forget to leave any project ideas in the issue section which I should do

-Got the new script in the expermental branch working I have been testing it but it may or may not work for your distro
if so, please say in the issue section and make sure you include the branch info,
I am currently setting up VM's to test if they work on that distro
but it seems that virtualbox doesn't want to work (typical) I am determined to make it work so testing is easier
and more precise.

-Main Server for the update service is under maintenance and should be back online later on
-Back up Server for the update service is online
-BU-V1RC8 is a bug fix release designed to fix when the update service is offline and the script can't continue,
and also to verify that the back up server is working
-Later on I will implement a better system for updates

-Hello to everyone who has used Bluetooth-Unlock, Happy new year!, I have had a long time away from Bluetooth-Unlock, due
to having some personal issues (2 family members have died, and 3 have cancer, one of which died due to it being terminal)
it has been hard for me as I am only 14 years old and having extra pressure of GCSE's but will be returining to work on 
this project because of the support of my family, friends and school. This year I'll be back working on making a gui for
Bluetooth-Unlock, adding support for windows and mac os and will be working on other projects such as 
making a version of UBports for the: Samsung Galaxy A5 (2015), Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016), Samsung Galaxy S9 and S8.
I am excited to make the UBports for the devices as I have them and can easily test and support them as Bluetooth-Unlock
is Stable as is and I'm very impressed on the progress of this project as it only started as a simple basic script but now
has formed into a Stable, useful program which anyone can use for free, and soon it will have a modern, easy gui.
And again, have a happy new year!
