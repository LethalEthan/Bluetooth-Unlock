-I've got an email from a site called piece,
where they sell source code they have proposed the idea that I could sell my program on there 
I want to keep this software free and under the MIT license forever
free for everyone, free to modify :) to earn money from my projects I will add a donation link instead

-Forgot to put in here that I added a donation link on the website (https://lethalethan.github.io/Bluetooth-Unlock/)
so hopefully I can create more useful projects in the near future
-Don't forget to leave any project ideas in the issue section which I should do

-Got the new script in the expermental branch working I have been testing it but it may or may not work for your distro
if so, please say in the issue section and make sure you include the branch info,
I am currently setting up VM's to test if they work on that distro
but it seems that virtualbox doesn't want to work (typical) I am determined to make it work so testing is easier
and more precise.

-Main Server for the update service is under maintenance and should be back online later on
-Back up Server for the update service is online
-BU-V1RC8 is a bug fix release designed to fix when the update service is offline and the script can't continue,
and also to verify that the back up server is working
-Later on I will implement a better system for updates
